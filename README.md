# **Book Recommendation System**
## Problem Statement
### In a very general way, recommender systems are algorithms aimed at suggesting relevant items to users (items being movies to watch, text to read, products to buy, or anything else depending on industries).
### Recommender systems are really critical in some industries as they can generate a huge amount of income when they are efficient or also be a way to stand out significantly from competitors. The main objective is to create a book recommendation system for users.
### This Book-crossing dataset contains three files: Users, Books, Ratings.

> * #### Contains three datasets: books, users and ratings.
> * #### Performed Data Preprocessing on these three datasets and then merged them.
> * #### Performed EDA to get insights on users, books etc.
> * #### Used Popularity based and Collaborative filtering based approaches for our recommender system.
> * #### For Collaborative filtering: Memory (Item-Item) and Model (User-User) based approaches.
> * #### Implemented KNN based algorithm for Memory based system and SVD for Model based system.
> * #### Recall@5: 30% and Recal@10: 41% for SVD.
